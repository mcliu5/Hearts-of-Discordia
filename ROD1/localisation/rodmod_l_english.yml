rodmod.5.title:0 "The Imperial Conference"
rodmod.5.desc:0 "The Imperial Council convenes in the City of Bojana. A sense of calm is in the city, even with the riots of the past days. It seems that news of this conference has softened the pro-democracy protester's riots, and that the conference will at least begin in peace.\n\n\n\nThe attendees take their seats.\n\n\n\nThe first one to speak is the Emperor, Amullian I. The longest reigning Emperor in Amullian history takes the floor.\n\n\n\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen, Citizens and Visitors, I recognize that it is time for change...\"\n\n\n\nHis speech goes on for a brief 30 minutes, before the next man takes the stand. The conference continues on, ideologies debated, and solutions found. At the end of the day, the delegates find the following.\n\n\n\n1. The pro-Cosmical Faction wants reform.\n\n2. The pro-Amullian Faction does not.\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing this obvious declaration and waste of time, the conference continues. The summer heat of the City makes its way into the conference, as the environment agitates.\n\n\n\nEven so, the heat ridden delegates strive for a compromise, and the Emperor, perhaps tired from the days of riots and weeks of protests, finally aquieses. \n\n\n\nFinally, a Compromise has been found. The Amullian Nation breathes a sigh of relief. There will be no civil war, not now, and for the first time since the Bleu Riots, the nation is united, and the ship of state is steady. The nation has dodged a bullet. It has steered clear of revolution and reaction, and the nation, although troubled, has survived."
